# RGB Color Game
A simple JavaScript game that tests your knowledge of RGB color values.


### How It Works
- There are two levels: easy and hard.
- The easy mode has three colors to choose from
- The hard mode has six colors to choose from
- The RGB value in the title is the color that you are trying to identify.
- Click on the square with the corresponding color to "guess".
- A "Try Again" message will appear if you have chosen the incorrect square.
- "New Colors" refreshes the displayed RGB value and displays a new assortment of colored squares.
